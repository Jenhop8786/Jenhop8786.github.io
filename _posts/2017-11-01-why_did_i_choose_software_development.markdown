I've always wanted to go to infinity and beyond.
It all goes back to when I was 6 or 7 years old. I spent a lot of time with my uncle John who was an Architect. He mostly drafted for residencial places like apartments and homes. I remember watching him on the computer and him showing me the program he had to use in order to create models of the places he was going to help build. It wasn't just the art aspect of it that kept me so fascintated but it was the computer and the program itself. I remember always going back home and wondering how the heck did that machine do that? Then one day my mom brought home a Macintosh Plus. To say I was obsessed is an understatement. I didn't really know what I was doing half of the time but I remember opening files and trying my hardest to "get inside the brain" of this computer. I never did figure it out. As years passed my interests varied but it was always in the back of my mind that I wanted to do something with computers. I didn't know what exactly though. 

I took jobs repairing hardware on computers and also volunteered to teach seniors how to use basic programs like Word and how to surf the internet. I thought maybe that was my "thing", teaching or informing people on how to use computers and how they are beneficial. I took a position at Best Buy in the electronics department. I was the lead computer associate, mainly dedicated to the Apple products, so whenever customers came in looking at a Mac, I would be the go to person to give information and lock in the sale. After  being in that positon for about 5 months it started to get boring to me. **Stagnant**. An Apple rep told me apply to Apple and next thing you know I am working for Apple troubleshooting hardware and software issues. The best part was I got to work from home. It was a remote position and IT WAS WITH APPLE! I thought I found where I wanted to be career wise. I had such a high working for this company. I woke up excited to work every day. 

Then it happened... 

After two and a half years and not moving up or any where for that matter. I became stagnant again.. I didn't think it could be possible. I went from being excited to work to only working because they had great benefits I didn't want to lose because I had kids I needed to take care of. I winded up leaving Apple and going to Microsoft and working as a sales associate in the mall. I had that new job excitement and it was fun for the first few weeks but deep down I knew it was not where I wanted to be. I wanted to be the person who created the programs that I was helping our customers understand how to use. I wanted to be the person looking inside the brain of the programs. 

That's what brought me here. Software development is like a circle, it's never ending in the problems, the creations and the work is never the same. I feel like this is the direction I have always been going in and I know I'll never find myself being stagnant again. To infinity and beyond!
