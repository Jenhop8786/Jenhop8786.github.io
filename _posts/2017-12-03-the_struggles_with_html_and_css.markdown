When I was first introduced to HTML was when I signed up for a Myspace page. Does anyone remember that? If you wanted to the coolest page you had to know HTML. I thought that going through the modules in Learn was going to be a breeze. But apparently things have changed. Not much, but enough for me to feel like I didn't know what the heck was going on. That is just HTML, doing that alongside with CSS I found myself staring at the screen more often than I anticipated. I don't know if it was because I didn't have an open book or notes to look back at (thinking about it now, I should have jotted down notes to refer to since there is so much code to write to build a page) but I just found myself being stuck because I wasn't retaining the information from CSS. I was more afraid of entering the wrong word in the wrong place and completely ruining the whole lab and having to start over again.

Good thing is that didn't happen and I was able to complete each lab with what was required. I kept going back to the video tutorials to get me through it. I didn't want to have to rely so much on the videos, I wanted to rely on my memory and understanding of how HTML and CSS working alonside eachother but when you are first learning, not everything goes the way you want it to. That's what learning is, right? 

I learned HTML is like the child and CSS is the parent. Without CSS and it's instruction, then HTML wouldn't work or look as great as it should. So you really can't use one without the other if you are trying to make something appealing to the eye and easy to work with on any device. I look back at my Myspace days and I realized I was slapping stickers on a peice of paper basically. I am still not super confident in my skills with HTML and CSS but I am willing to put in the time and effort needed to get a better understanding and get to a place that I need to be at to feel confident enough to build pages on my own.
