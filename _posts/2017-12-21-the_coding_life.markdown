Can I compare the coding problems or lessons, I have come across so far, to any aspect of my life?

As I go through these lessons and labs I only have one question that goes through my mind everytime. It's "why the heck is this so hard?" I guess you can say I ask that a lot in my life. Almost everyday I encounter something that I think is hard whether it's in the coding camp or in my day to day routine. But in reality it's just something that appears to be difficult, mostly because I wasn't prepared for it or it looks overwhelming and I haven't even started it yet.  That's how coding has been for me so far. I open up a lab and instantly think it's going to be hard and impossible to finish in a reasonable amount of time. I have that "assume the worst" mind state. 

In the beggining I had the expectation that this bootcamp would be easy. Why in the world did I think that? I have no idea to be honest. I thought with the little experience I already had (codeacademy, treeehouse) I would be able to breeze through all of this. I feel like I am in this competition with myself and try to finish a lab as fast as I can. But that isn't always the case. I tend to overlook and read into things way too much and I spend more time reading over the same lines than actually just working through them. I want to finish this bootcamp giving it my all just like how I want to get through life the best I can. When I am coding lines and checking to see if my tests will pass I get this little heart attack everytime. I know if I fail I can continue to try until I pass them, I always get that 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th chance. Just like in life, if I don't succeed in the first try, I can keep trying until I get it right or succeed. 

I have 3 kids I raise while going through this camp and people always tell me, parenting must be way harder than that "coding stuff." When I sit back and think about it, parenting is easy. I feel like when you are a parent, everything just comes easily and you know what to do and don't need to "check your work."  Building programs or even the Tic Tac Toe Board I had to build in the beginning was very difficult for me and I never questioned my ability to do things before I built that board, but for those lessons and labs, I questioned everything. 

Even though I have come across and know I will come across more difficult times in this camp, I wouldn't stop for anything. I love this coding life just like I love my parenting life. Every lesson I do, I know I am walking away with something I didn't know before and I am learning a skill that will be with me for a lifetime.
