What was something you struggled with in learning about Forms ? Explain your current understanding of it..

I think the overall concepts of creating Forms and using them properly was challenging for me.  It was also a topic I didn't realize had to do with something that I use literally, everyday. Creating Forms wasn't hard but wasn't easy either.  Yes, you type certain lines of code that accept input then output it in a particular way. When you are filling out these forms on websites, for example, when you online shop, you don't ever think of the "behind the scenes" process to it all. At least, I don't think that's what goes on in people's minds at the time.  As a seasoned developer you don't think that these basic lines of code are at all complex in anyway. But for a beginner, a newbie like me, yes, it's all complex in sense. You are telling this program to ask for a name, a address, a phone number and a credit card number and then that program is responsible for taking that information and sends it off to this other place in order to get a box delivered to your door with an item that you paid for online. 

The things I struggled with the most is using the correct way of "asking" for that information and having the ability to use it the way it is intended.  I never thought that words could mean so much and be so important, especially when they are considered objects in the programming language you are learning to write.
