I found this project more difficult than anticipated. A lot of it wasn't whether I could code or scrape correctly, a lot of it was me being stuck in my own head and wanting every aspect of the project to be perfect. It is the first of five projects and I felt like this is what is going to define me as a student since it's a project that wraps up every thing we have learned so far and then some. It wasn't hard to figure out what my project was going to be on, I actually had a list written up and eventually went with one that I had a personal experience with, which was finding a great coding bootcamp school. So my project was based around that. 

After forking and cloning into IDE I realized I wanted to build my project from scratch, scratch. I knew eventually we wouldn't be using IDE in our real jobs so I wanted to expose myself to what it would be like without using it. It was challenging, to say the least. So, I used the application Atom (for Mac) which Learn uses too and I used this alongside with Terminal. I don't know how many times I found myself starting over and over and over because either I wasn't cd'ing into the correct directory or I was missing files. The most difficult part I came across was bundling my gem. I kept getting errors in Terminal that were saying I didn't have the right permissions or didn't have access. After scouring the net for help I found that all I needed to do was log into bash right from my Terminal. 

Once all the bumps passed I was able to get started with my methods, classes and scraping. The initial program wasn't the greatest. It threw everything at you at once. When you started the program it looked messy, crowded and it was obvious I was still very new to all of this. I knew and know how important having clean code is so I went back over everything at most 20 times. Changing this, changing that or removing and adding small things here and there.  When it came to testing it out after all the changes, I was surprised that I had built something. 

This project helped teach me to leave notes to remind myself why this line went here and that line went there. It's a habit I think is crucial for anyone who wants to become a developer. I coudn't keep count on how many times I lost myself or where I was because I wasn't leaving notes where I should have. I played with it probably a dozen times knowing the outcome each time, but I was just fixated on the fact that this was a glimpse into the future for me. That I was going to be doing more of this, but more complex I'm sure.  I had some family members test it out and give me feedback on how they felt it was overall. They were just as shocked as I was that they were using something I built.
