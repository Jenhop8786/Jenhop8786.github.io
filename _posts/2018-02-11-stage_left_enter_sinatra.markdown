 When I hear the word Sinatra I immediatly think of Frank Sinatra or as some called him, "Swoonatra". His voice, music and all around vibe was smooth and enjoyable. In the coding world I would say Sinatra is pretty close.  I was intimidated when I saw I was getting into this part of the curriculum because that meant I was that much closer to the end. I decided to throw on some Frank Sinatra on Pandora to see if it would ease some of my anxiety.  Turns out, all the hubbub was in my head and I was just syking myself out because in this part of the curriculum things get more serious and that means you have alot more to process and retain. 
 
 Up until this point I feel like me and Ruby haven't gotten to know eachother pretty well and I hope to continue to build on this relationship of ours. I've barely got to the edge of the pool with Sinatra so I will update as soon as I get my toes wet.
