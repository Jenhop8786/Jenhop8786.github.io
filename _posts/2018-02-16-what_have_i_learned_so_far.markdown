Prior to Flatiron I was self teaching on Codeacademy and reading various books on Ruby programming, HTML/CSS and a very little bit of Python. Anyways, I still use Codeacademy and programming books alongside Flatiron so that I keep the process of writing code consistent through out the day. But using Codeacademy is just like having someone hold your hand the entire time. They don't dive too much into defining the methods or process you are learning. They tell you the jist of things and keep you moving. I never really dug into researching the terms they use or retaining the information I was reading in books. Which were mistakes I have made and I have come to accept and learned from. 

It never occurred to me that I didn't fully understand what the difference between 'require' and 'require_relative' was. I honestly thought that you could use them interchangably but throughout this program I am having to use them exclusively for different purposes. When I decided to Google the differences I was immediately overwhelmed with the amount of opinions and different examples there are about these two processes. One blog post said using 'require_relative' was "bad  habit" and most experienced developers just use 'require'. Where the truth in that is, I have no idea and I wasn't about to go asking developers I connected with on LinkedIN because I didn't even know where to begin and I didn't want to sound like a complete newbie. 

SO where did that leave me? 

Confused and staring at my screen and wondering how could two seemibly important process's cause this much of a headache? 

I found a few bloggers who appeared pretty well-versed in Ruby and read up on what their take was on all of this 'Require' rif-raf. After sifting through about 3 posts, I understood that 'require' is a method that is used when you want to reference/execute code that you don't have written in the current file. It also loads external dependancies. An example is that it loads Gems, or what ever is in your $LOAD_PATH. If you need a method that provides a more dirent link, you would use 'require_relative. Require_relative loads what** is ** in your current directory and you can call a file specifically by adding an absolute path like ./lib/coding. That is saying, "Hey follow this path until you get to this destination." I can't believe it was that simple. I know you can do the shorthand with 'require' also but distinguining the two makes it easier if you aren't a pro developer yet.  

How did I get this far without knowing what those two differences were? Like some people, I retain the information needed to pass an exam or lab and then that information just falls out of my head or hides somewhere. I couldn't instantly recall things that I had learned prior and that had me worried. It was only when I returned to those previous labs or worked on something in Codeacademy that seemed familiar was when I had the "Oh yeah, I remember that" moment. If you want to be a successful developer, then definitely don't do what I did. I have had too many "Oh yeahs" and now it's biting me in the rear.
