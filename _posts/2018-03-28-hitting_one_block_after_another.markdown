And I am not talking about the method "Do."

It has been close to 2 months since my first portfolio project was submitted.  Experiencing failure after failure, it took me 3 tries to realize it wasn't my code failing. It was my inablity to properly articulate how my code works and how it wouldn't work if you changed lines or added incorrect method/variable usage. During this whole process I had a mind state that if you just push through the work as quickly as possible you will be done quicker. 
When did this type of thinking start? 
Well, I took online classes from my local community college a couple of years ago and I got into the habit of just learning enough to pass the quizzes and get through group sessions. I wasn't practicing or even doing enough to remember what I learned after the quizzes because I knew when finals came up that I could just go back through the lessons that were gonna help me pass the finals and be done with it. And usually I would just submit a paper to my professor and he would email back his/her thoughts.
Look at how far that mind frame got me. Not far. At all.

I wasn't aware that I was just building this wall taller and taller by not recognizing what I was doing wrong. 
When I talk about how I wasn't articulating the process correctly, I am talking about how I pointed to a block of code and literally saying "well if you put that line of code there, then that other line of code will work or won't work." 
Does that sound like I know what the heck is going on or that I understood how to write code at all? 
Not really. And my reviewers looked at it that way also. 
The hardest thing about self-paced programs is that you create these bad habits, either cause they make things easier or because no one is there to tell you you're wrong. I am guilty of both in this program. 
What turned it around for me was a few things. 
I became stagnant for a week or so. Just not wanting to do anything and having a pitty party for myself. I lost all motivation and confidence and I was angry. Angry that these teachers were not passing me. The egotistical part of me kept saying "I built an app, it works, so what's the big deal?" After a week passed and I started to come to my senses, I decided I needed to be better. I started this program to gain a new skill but also because it was something I was passionate about. By signing up at this school and in this online program, I wanted to teach my daughters discipline and self-control when you don't have to sit in a classroom with a teacher. 

When I used to repair computers I never told a customer "if you remove this metal piece, then this other metal piece will stop working, and so will the big part that makes it all work together."
Like, looking at that sentence I just wrote makes me *cringe*. 
I don't know why I thought that I could get away with talking like that now. Being alone 80% of the time should not be an excuse for not consistenly practicing the right way to do and say things. I would never get a job if I explained a project or answered interview questions in that manner. 

So why did I think it was ok to do it with my first portfolio project or even in general?

> **In all honesty**. I thought I was just going to run my CLI and they were going to have feedback and that was it. I thought I was going to just correct my code errors, if any came up, and move on. I was sooo wrong. In so many ways.

These last few weeks was just me focusing on really learning how to code. Understanding the right way to present how code works and doesn't work. Learning how methods talk to eachother and being able to explain it has been the real challenge. Talking to myself using the correct verbage and terminology when I type something into a file is something I am making a habit of. 

And as my 4th attempt is approaching, I feel more confident in the sense that I will actually know how to talk about my CLI and all the methods that make it work.  Keeping my fingers crossed.
