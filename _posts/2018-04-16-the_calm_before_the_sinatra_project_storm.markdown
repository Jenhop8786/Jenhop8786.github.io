Prior to my CLI affair, I had started on the Sinatra module and was almost done with it. (This was before I had to go back through the lessons I needed to pass my CLI). IF that wasn't confusing then continue reading or go back one blog post and read up on all the *drama*. Jk, there really wasn't any but anyways.. Back to Sinatra, I went back through the module and re-did all of the labs that I had done before and it was funny because I was going through these lessons and labs with "new eyes" and it was so much easier to understand what I was reading, because I wasn't reading the material just to get me passed it as quickly as possible (like before). I found myself talking out loud in "developer verbage" and predicting what was going to happen, and actually being right about it! I was super stoked and I was excited that I knew what was going on this time..

I was also impatient and didn't want to wait until the end to start my project. So I just started with the basic stuff. I will be honest and say that I restarted and changed my idea a million times before I actually created a repository on Github and by then I already had my file structure made and most of what I needed to put into my models, views and controllers folder.  This project just felt different from my last one. I felt 10,000 times more confident throughout the process and whenever I started to doubt myself I would just go back through the lessons or spend a little bit more time Googling, to get a better understanding of what I was getting stuck on. 

I created an app that you can keep track of tasks in, but I based the idea more around a family using it to keep up with stuff around the home. I'm not quite ready to submit the project. I have a few more "Testing it out" tries before I hit that button, but I feel like when I do get there, I won't be as worried and won't be questioning whether or not I can explain my project and how it works, which is something I never cared for before but has become so important to me now and will be going forward.
