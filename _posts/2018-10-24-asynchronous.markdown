I thought my Ruby on Rails project was difficult. No way.. This one takes the cake (for now). 

I will probably say the same thing about the final project too. SO, my assumption was that this would be easy as pie because I had the Rails backend and all I was doing was adding on the front. Rails is magical and handles everything with ease right? 

It sounded so simple.

But four and half months later, I finally made it. Why did it take so long? Mostly self doubt AND facing the fact I was nearing the end END of the bootcamp, I sort of procrastinated at times. I was digesting as much content to make sure I really understood what I was doing. I even reached out to a fellow graduate and asked for some advice on how to better retain what I was learning and he actually said don't retain EVERYTHING, but things you need in order to get things done because some companies will have you learn something new and you might not use what you learned previously. That made me look at what I was doing in a different light. I was trying to consume every thing and that made it harder for me to feel confident that I could take on this new language, so I took his advice and just ran with what I already knew and just started building away for this project. Any bump I hit was when I referred to my most reliable resources (that I bookemarked) and just looked up how to fix it, instead of trying to remember that all at once like in the beginning.  

Entering this world of Javascript was intimidating to me. You are learning a new language on top of continuing to internilize the previous languages you learned before this one. But it felt pretty cool to be considered "Bi-lingual" in the end of it (haha). 

The requirements for this project were to:
Render at least an index page & show page, and dynamically render a page with a one-has-many relationshop through JSON using Javascript(comments on a post). We had to also use Javascript to render a form for creating a resource that submits dynamically. I used my Task form for this. A user would create a Task, then it appends to the Assignment page without a reload. It was cool to watch the page NOT reload. 

If you ever pay attention to posting stuff on Facebook and notice the page does not reload or refresh - that's the dynamical magic in the workings.  This journey has had so many ups and downs but I am so glad to finally see that finish line approaching.
