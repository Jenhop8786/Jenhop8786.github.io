<p>For as long as I can remember I wanted to build things, but not just anything, things that would make people happy, so I could be responsible for a little piece of joy in their lives. I didn’t know what I would build or how I would do it, but one day my uncle, who was an architect, showed me a program called AutoCad. There was a problem and he fixed it, by going into the source code. It was like a whole new world opened up to me and I was hooked. My friends thought it was weird when I would always look at the source code on the websites I visited, but I felt fascinated.</p>

<p>That deep fascination led me to enroll in the coding bootcamp through Flatiron, I wanted to broaden my understand of web and software development so that I could create amazing infrastructure behind AutoCad, MacOS, Windows or Facebook.  At Flatiron, I worked on web applications that were both task-based and CLI.  I completed all of these using the Ruby programming language, of which, I have become quite fluent.</p>

<p>Programming is my passion and I intend to work in field for the rest of my career. I am enthralled with the impact that stringing little lines of code together can have on our ever emerging technology and, thus, the future of our society. I can’t wait to see what comes next!</p>
